# Impact of Weather Conditions on Air Quality

## Overview

The aim of this analysis is to use SQL to determine the factors that have an influence on air pollution.
For this study, we worked on on the Beijing PM 2.5 public dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Beijing+PM2.5+Data#

The data set contains hourly PM 2.5 data of US Embassy in Beijing from Jan 1st, 2010 to Dec 31st, 2014.

## Problem Definition

The air quality index in Beijing has increased over time. This may negatively impact not just the general populace but also the ecosystem as a whole and all species that live there.

## Solution

With the PM 2.5 pollutant as our primary emphasis, we will analyze and quantify the effect on the increase in the Air Quality Index. It has been discoverd that when levels of the air pollutant fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) are excessive, it poses a risk to people's health.
PM 2.5 are extremely small, inhalable particles that typically have a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less and come from a variety of sources.

The data was cleaned and explored using SQL Server and the resulting clean SQL file linked and displayed in Power BI to generate a dashboard of the findings.
